Crowd Noise Meter!

This is an interractive meter that will function to display approval ratings through dynamic animation, as it is generated by people clicking a button that shows their approval! Each click will increase the count in a database, then automatically delete itself after a given number of seconds. 

To use:

1. Open your terminal and cd into the crowdNoise directory

2. Run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies

3. Run "npm run start" to see the button and view in action!

To change the database in firebase or the duration length of the data persistence, you can change the values in the local config file.

** If you make any changes to the files, you can run "npm run txtify" in your terminal to output a new build.js script that will reflect your changes **
