Crowd Noise Meter!

This is an interractive meter that will function to display approval ratings through dynamic animation, as it is generated by people clicking a button that shows their approval! Each click will increase the count in a database, then automatically delete itself after a given number of seconds. 

To use:

1. Open your terminal and cd into the crowdNoise directory

2. Run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies

3. To see the button, run "npm run button-start" in your terminal to open a button in your browser.

4. To see the meter, run "npm run meter-start" in your terminal to open crowd noise meter in your browser.

To change the database in firebase, the animation speed, or the duration length of the data persistence, you can change the values in the local config file.
